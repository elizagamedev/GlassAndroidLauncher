# Glass Android Launcher

This is a Google Glass app which displays and launches installed native Android apps.

## Running

This sample does not require any additional setup. Open the project in Android Studio, connect your device, and press Play to launch the app!

(If that doesn't work, please submit a PR, since it's been a while since I've touched this and I probably messed up something.)
